        <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
        <p>My research findings will go here. <a href="#!">Maybe with a link to the research/survey/fancy graphs so that I don't bore people who don't care about it.</a></p>
        <p>This is probably where I would introduce Stop the Bleed. <a href="#!">Again with links to their respective organizations</a></p>
